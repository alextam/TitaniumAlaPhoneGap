Welcome to TitaniumAlaPhoneGap Sample Project Build from Appcelerator Titanium Mobile Project

- I have successful, implement a work around and identified the root of the javascript event problem.
It turns out backbone.js will destroy all delegate on page change rendering the Ti.App.addEventListener useless
in Android. To work around, I script inject into memory an Ti.App.addEventListener.

To get it working For IOS device, you must first rename all js files (skip the ejs) to jsf or as file (as long is not
JS - for some reason the builder takes the js files and compiles it into other form).

Dont forget to reflect it at index.html
